Three species of Iris flowers - Iris-setosa, Iris-versicolor and Iris-virginica are given. In this given dataset for every species 50 data given for sepal
length, sepal width, petal length and petal width. 

Using python these operations have done:
1. top five rows of the dataset
2. extract the specific dataset with a name
3. get the no. of unique values
4. check if there any null values
5. get the mean, standard deviation of with a specific column name
6. get the mean corresponding to every distinct species

These commands have been used to perform above mentioned tasks:
1. head()
2. .value_counts()
3. groupby()
4. isnull()
5. mean()
6. std()
7. .nunique()
8. .count()
